## ⚠️ Action Required From You

### 1. Fix Supabase RLS Policies
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Quick fix for testing
ALTER TABLE form_submissions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE email_subscribers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
Or use the production-ready policies in `fix-rls-policies.sql`

### 2. Add Your Calendly URL
Edit `/app/form/page.tsx` line 186:
```tsx
url="https://calendly.com/your-actual-calendly-url"
```

Edit `/app/page.tsx` line 17:
```tsx
const WHATSAPP_GROUP_LINK = 'your-actual-whatsapp-link';
